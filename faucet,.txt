ive been farting for too long trying to use netter, and then parse it, and log it, and switch instances, that ive put more than enough money into trying to solve it, that i decided, for somthing like this, im going to pay the $200 so we can make a million dollar application

and is a direct exchange of value, intermediated by cryptographically secure immutable persistant data. 

We have 10 communities already ready to use this tool. 

i really want to find out how we can hook into uniswap, unichain, and the v4 hooks for TWAMM
[07:58 PM]
we can route our auto transactions to initiate constant matching flow in and out, coding in a liquid threshold, that the faucets will never run out

Uniswap Protocol
Uniswap v4 Truncated Oracle Hook
This example Uniswap v4 hook implements a Truncated Geometric Mean oracle. This oracle is more resistant to manipulation techniques by blunting the price impact of large trades.

iight, as long as that means itll be a minimum viable product for me to launch and a beta, im cool. 

then we can keep the ball rolling,

Marsniper27 — 11/10/2024 11:40 PM
100% we will get it all going. I have the bot currently running on my pc I will get it up on the server so its more stable might fix some of these issues currently having with it.

how do i call the erc20 faucet?
[10:01 PM]
server faucet?
[10:02 PM]
and how do i get erc20 balances?
[10:02 PM]
its working tho
[10:02 PM]
kudos!!!

Marsniper27 — Yesterday at 10:05 PM
base eth faucet is /use_faucet
erc20 faucets are set per channel right now (will be per server) so in the other channels use /server_faucet
[10:05 PM]
to check erc20 balance you can use the /get_wallet_token_balance  command

Marsniper27

Marsniper27 — Yesterday at 10:06 PM
this gives option of selecting from programmed tokens in the list or entering a token address

MonkeyMike.eth — Yesterday at 10:06 PM
okay. can we make these NON ephermal. 
we actually need the server to show the claims 
the only ephermal needs is secret keys

MonkeyMike.eth — Yesterday at 10:06 PM
okay so, currently the channels ID are acting as server Id? (edited)

MonkeyMike.eth — Yesterday at 10:07 PM
can we do a full balance too ?
[10:07 PM]
like all inside the wallet (edited)

wat about gating the function by role? (edited)

Marsniper27 — Yesterday at 10:10 PM
thats super easy.

1

MonkeyMike.eth — Yesterday at 10:10 PM
awesome. great news.
[10:10 PM]
wat about increasing the claim amount due to the having a roles ?
[10:11 PM]
the current iteration we have, is using the Unbelievaboat 

and it gives you x$ according to which "income roles" the user has
[10:12 PM]
we dont have to duplicate
but the closer we are to that the easier the migration to this
[10:12 PM]
both
[10:12 PM]
socially
[10:12 PM]
and technically (edited)
[10:12 PM]
just spitballing

Marsniper27 — Yesterday at 10:15 PM
We can setup in the db a list of roles and the reward amount for them then when they use the faucet it will verify thier roles against the ones in the db and use that to determine the reward. if no roles they can get the tiny base amount to keep them aroudn and make them want the other roles
[10:15 PM]
We can have global roles as well as server specific roles

MonkeyMike.eth — Yesterday at 10:15 PM
PERFECT
[10:15 PM]
last crazy thing for now ,
then wat about requiring a tweet . 
can we verify a tweet to be able to claim ?

Marsniper27 — Yesterday at 10:16 PM
did you end up grabbing a twitter api sub?

MonkeyMike.eth — Yesterday at 10:16 PM
im thinking about it. thats why i asked
[10:16 PM]
hahahaha
[10:16 PM]
i have a free dev one
[10:16 PM]
but idk the scope (edited)

Marsniper27 — Yesterday at 10:17 PM
they have REALLY tight security so cant just scrape. i will ahve to double check what is available for the free one havent looked at it in a few months and it was right when they were changing everything

MonkeyMike.eth — Yesterday at 10:17 PM
