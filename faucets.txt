DB:Faucets

   |               |              maxBalance:cut off for faucet usage

Do we just want to have global settings for all faucets then have the db track users usage for each token per user:



DB:Faucets
   |___>Collection: GuildId
   |               |___>Entry:
   |               |             _id:TokenName
   |               |              payout:amount to pay out
   |               |              maxBalance:cut off for faucet usage
   |               |              timer:timer value
   |               |___>Entry:
   |                             _id:UserId
   |                             faucets:[{
   |                                 token:tokenName
   |                                 lastUse:Timestamp
   |                             }]
   |___>Collection: GuildId
.......


Or do we want settings per server for how they want the faucet to work?
